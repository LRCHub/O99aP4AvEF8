Bless you, Andy
Hood baby

I got that Glock on the seat (sheesh)
I feel in love with a freak (a freak)
I hit it once and hit in a week
Hood baby surfin' with your bitch on the beach (let's go)
Hit and I quit, yeah that bitch got released
I got a bitch and she waiting for me (yeah)
[?] Rollie, yeah two tone bling (talk to em)

Rocking the mink (mink mink), racks in the bank (bank bank)
Leave that boy stank (leave that boy stank),
Make that bitch plank (make that bitch plank)
She rolling dank (dank dank), we rolling dank (dank dank)
No, it's too stank (no, it's too stank),
My diamonds a sink (my diamonds a sink)
And I'm not a saint (I'm not a saint),
She going for the train (she going for the gang)
My teeth with get flooded (teeth will get flooded),
I'm going Johnny, mayne (I'm going Johnny, mayne)
I send her get Barbie (send her get Barbie),
I'm driving that lane (I'm driving that Range)
Dropping the top (skrt, skrt), I switch out the lanes

Boy, yo ass lame (boy, yo ass lame),
Can't be the gang (you not the gang)
I'm not a snitch, I got me some pointers, it look like some rain
[?] no ceiling cause I'm doing the dash in the rain
They don't like the way I do drugs,
They thinking I'm going insane (going insane)
Can't talk back, too turnt,
And I'm riddin' round the city with racks and rocks
If I her get her back,
Imma knock that pussy out the park like I played on Sandlot
No nigga, fuck a new nigga,
Still with the same nigga from the same block
Smoking the leaf, big high like Khalifa
Show him how to get more neef (racks)
No time for lil nigga, more cheese
Slimed you out, we gone keep it in the streets
White trap, [?]
Big guns tooting all the heat
Fuck it, I'll chop out the top
Fuck it just pop it and top
Send the boy straight to your pops
He even look good in the sky
Southside woah, bitch this Southside woah (woah)
Hood Baby chain white gold, or I might switch to the rose (woah)
Nigga, I ain't never never told, but this beat got wrote
Heard you going out like a hoe, and his heart got soul (it's crazy)

Rocking the mink (mink mink), racks in the bank (bank bank)
Leave that boy stank (leave that boy stank),
Make that bitch plank (make that bitch plank)
She rolling dank (dank dank), we rolling dank (dank dank)
No, it's too stank (no, it's too stank),
My diamonds a sink (my diamonds a sink)
And I'm not a saint (I'm not a saint),
She going for the train (she going for the gang)
My teeth with get flooded (teeth will get flooded),
I'm going Johnny, mayne (I'm going Johnny, mayne)
I send her get Barbie (send her get Barbie),
I'm driving that lane (I'm driving that Range)
Dropping the top (skrt, skrt), I switch out the lanes
