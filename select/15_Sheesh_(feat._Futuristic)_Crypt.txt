If you ain't ready to get pumped
Take your joke ass home!
And we do not give a fuck
It's a no wack zone!
Get the fuck up!
Get the fuck up!
Get the fuck up!
Get the fuck up!

Now, lean back in yo seat
Let the beat slap and say sheesh
We gonna blow your mind
With every single rhyme
You're gonna have to get on your feet
Now get up on it
Flow with me
You made your bed
Now fold the sheets
The door is locked
I own the key
I don't like you
So, I say sheesh

Everybody thinkin' they amazing
But I'ma show you homie that you not that
I been workin' on this day to day
And it's safe to say I came in the game and I cock back
And I chop tracks and I pop back
On any muthafucka thinkin' they can stop my ass
I rock the rap like Slipknot, got the game Ziploc
Fresh with the shit talk
Bitch, stop to the tip top
Just to piss off any bitch then I lift off
When I shoot I gotta quick draw, you just pissed off
'Cause I'm climbin' in the rocket
While you ridin' in the bottom of a rickety-ricksaw
I don't play no games, my name ain't Jigsaw
But I'm quick to slice, and that's it cut a bitch off
I run this shit like I was fuckin' rich
So, call me Bischoff, or Rick Ross I'm a big boss
Lyrical Rappers, anyone attacks us
Is getting hit with the toe tag, yes
Flow magic, so spastic, go-go flow gadget
I'm so graphic, but no fascist
The pope has his Holy Ghost passion
To my dome just know I'ma go psychopathic
Hot like a match is
Swipe from the mantis, a pipe from the mattress
Just might fuck a bad bitch
It's madness when I write on a pad I don't — practice
I'm just good when I rap I know — I'm
Better than whatever you could thinkin' you can do
So, you better just admit that, you the lesser of us 2
Don't fuck with me, boy
I put you under with a couple other Gs, boy (Yes, he will!)
Everybody think they want a part of this beef
But I'm fat for a reason, I eat these beats

If you ain't ready to get pumped
Take your joke ass home!
And we do not give a fuck
It's a no wack zone!
Get the fuck up!
Get the fuck up!
Get the fuck up!
Get the fuck up!

Now, lean back in yo seat
Let the beat slap and say sheesh
We gonna blow your mind
With every single rhyme
You're gonna have to get on your feet
Now get up on it
Flowin me
You made your bed
Now fold the sheets
The door is locked
I own the key
I don't like you
So, I say sheesh

Yo, I made a phrase and they claimed that
I came from the mud, I was raised in the basement
Amazed at these lames and the things they be sayin'
They reppin' the streets let 'em lay on the pavement
I'm on some NWA shit
I go in the label and jump on the table
Say, "run me my payment" I'm nothing to play with
Put me on the playlist or I'm 'bout to break shit
Mask off, blast off I reppin' that facts off
Zach's soft? I put it on the gas
Makin' cash
You niggas broke take the cast off
I'm the type of cat that might get mad
If you been talkin' trash I'll let a track off
Scrape your face on the asphalt
Got your lady playing with my thingie
In the tub while I pour the bath salt
Talkin' 'bout ups and I be really about the Benjamins
Like I was with my cats and I be
Flyer than gods used to be up on a jet
'Cause I got bars like penitentiaries and welcome to corrections
Lookin' at the greatest while I'm seein' my reflection
I be eatin' everybody, someone give me a suggestion
Been a weapon I'm like I don't know answer if you ever had a question
I ain't even flexin' though, I'm the best with flow
I'm self driven like a Tesla goes
I 'bout my green like a vegetable
They wanna hang with me like a testicle, I'm at the festival
With a white chick and her sidekick
On my nightstick with a tight grip
On my guy Crypt
I hit it once then we might switch

If you ain't ready to get pumped
Take your joke ass home!
And we do not give a fuck
It's a no wack zone!
Get the fuck up!
Get the fuck up!
Get the fuck up!
Get the fuck up!

Now, lean back in yo seat
Let the beat slap and say sheesh
