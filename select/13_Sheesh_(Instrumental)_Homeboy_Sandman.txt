New plots old scenery
Stone cold as Coldstone Creamery
PowerPoint for pitching a scheme
They came to me as if in a dream
The board was like "Sheesh"
I earn a new power '
With each relationship that go sour
It be the way it is if it was up to me
I only shop at spots that used to give me stuff for free
Timeline of tying knots
Drones versus fireflies
Chrome over Firefox
Imploring you to find the self
Was nowhere near as good a time as unifyin' the belts
I'm way to large to be excited 'bout what's on the shelves
Most times I find they only carry sizes up to 12
During interviews I get confused as someone else
I'm underground on earth but really big in other realms
Off the market to the talking snake
Where there's milk instead of oil
And the soil taste like chocolate cake
I'm taking offers, 'bout to rent 'em out for office space
Cool beans, jellied or Boston baked?
Snacks are crossin' the Gibraltar strait
I smoked the altar's flame and woke up in an altered state
See you could taste the special sauces that I orchestrate
Veritable buffet of different flavors
Different favorites you could alternate
What ultimatum I ought to make
Hmm, finished living off the grid, I'm going straight
I'll also be selling the Brooklyn Bridge and Golden Gate
It's like the south was wilin' and I'm Honest Abe
That's just my way of saying that it's not a game
Which is my way of saying if somethings not okay
I'll break into some Karate

I only talk to strangers
The moment we're acquaintances I'm known to cut the anchors
I'm foaming at the cankers over yellow rows
Of molars growing at unholy angles
Overbite designed for cutting rope
And holding roman candles while exploding
A motion that exacerbates the smoker's cough
And usher in a shrapnel that'll hack the neighbors noses off
A little give a little take it seems
Bumblefuck defectors, trained to limbo any laser beams
Also trained in suction cups and cutting circles outta glass
Covering the cameras up, momma I'm a workin' man
Known to let the courtesies meander to an early grave
Walk up in the kaffeeklatsch, exterminate, exterminate
Twist the candlestick to spin the hidden room
Grow the type of plants that only witches use
I never really thought of you as anything but picnic food
I can't imagine this is news
Mammals playing chicken from mammals who pay for tickets
That's a patsy taking damage to advance another's interests
I'm pincer to the chisel tip, it sizzle when I sand it
Which matters if you let him channel middle school detention
The little engine couldn't, welcome to your intervention
A popery of friends and family sealing off the exits
Offering a wall of engines presenting as good intention
If it's all at once its all because you couldn't get the message ever
Aes sell bones to a grave
I know about the toll booth in front of home plate
Got a hoodie on the helmet hair, rubies in my dagger
Cougars on the TV, future in Valhalla
Old man winter throw a saddle on a lizard
I swat away the buzzards when I'm dragging home my dinner
DJ's in the Thursday early after dropping lights into the mixer
Like "Ladies and gentlemen we have a winner"
